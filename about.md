Hey! I am Shiva. I am a verification engineer by profession. I also teach maths. During my free time, I like exploring about ancient Indian philosophy, learn a thing or two about Indian history, or simply binge watch some series (probably some k-drama) or an anime. I like playing chess(find me [here](https://www.chess.com/member/lastbrook)), and basketball too!   

### More Information

I did my B.Tech in Electrical Engineering from IIT(ISM), Dhanbad, and M.Tech in Power Electronics from NIT, Trichy. I worked with Thermax for an year (where I worked on a fuel cell project) and later with Mojo Green (where I worked on fast chargers for EV4Ws). I've been working as verification engineer with the R&D team of the VIP product line at Siemens EDA since August 2022.
